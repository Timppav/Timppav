# Hello!
I study Information and Communications Technology (ICT) at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, majoring in Software Engineering.
I am mostly interested in fullstack web development with technologies such as React JS, but I try to learn a little bit of everything.

## School Projects
Some of the student group projects I have contributed to during my studies at Metropolia:

* [Whiteboard Realtime Drawing](https://github.com/PhongLe7de/Software_Engineering_Project_1_Group_4)
  * Fullstack web app that lets users draw on a whiteboard canvas and see each others' drawings in real time. Frontend React TypeScript, backend Java Springboot.

* [Group Finder](https://github.com/ckapiainen/group-finder)
 * Fullstack web app for creating and joining study groups. Made with React JavaScript.

* [Shop Checkout Simulator](https://github.com/ckapiainen/group5_simulator)
 * Java program that simulates store checkout queues.

* [Flight Game](https://github.com/WelehoBRUDER/AMK-flight-game)
  * Terminal game written in Python. First student project.

* [Flight Game 2](https://github.com/WelehoBRUDER/AMK-flight-game-2)
  * Re-imagining of the first Flight Game written in JavaScript.

## Personal Projects
Some projects I made on my free time for practice.
